* Especially in Go, projects should be structured using composition/behavior instead of state.
* Could structure often comes from starting with the Concrete types, and refactoring it using an interface
* Interfaces (or anything for that matter) should always somehow make your code better
* Interfaces should be used when a user provides an implementation detail, there could be multiple implementations, or when decoupling is required
* In testing, the tester can create their own mocks of working Concrete production code (don't need interface in application code)
* Decoupling means reducing the dependencies between components and the types they use

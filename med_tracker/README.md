This is my first ever attempt at creating a Go API. I thought I would do it using GraphQL. I was able to make different types of queries work, but I felt like my code was messy and I needed to develop a better understanding of Go and GraphQL before I could make this project as good as I want to. I also am questioning if GraphQL is "worth it" because of how 'verbose' it is for slight performance gains. I am going to move on from this project in order to develop a simpler Go REST API for web using http/templates. After that, I hope to update the API to return json so that I can use the API more generally, like for mobile (Flutter!) and maybe even a desktop App (still could be Flutter! And now that I am thinking about that... maybe change the web templates to Flutter Web).

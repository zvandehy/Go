# Go
Workspace for my Go projects:
* GoTraining:
Code and notes from William Kennedy's "Ultimate Go Programming" Series. 
Series: https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/ultimate-go-programming/9780134757476/9780134757476-ugpg_00_00_00_00
Repo: https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/tree/master/topics/go
* med_tracker:
First (unfinished) attempt at a GraphQL API with Go. End goal was to tracker my meds after getting my wisdom teeth extracted.
* budgeting:
Create a web-based budget tracker application using a Go API with web templates. Hopefully this is a more "responsible" attempt than 'med_tracker', and I can learn more about how to use Go for a variety of similar projects.


I clearly need to familiarize myself more with Go's naming conventions because my first two projects are using completely different conventions!
